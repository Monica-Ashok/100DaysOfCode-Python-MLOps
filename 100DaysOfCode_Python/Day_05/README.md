# Day 05 - Python Loops

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Python Loops:** Using `for` loops to iterate over a range of values.
- **Random Module:** Generating random values for password creation.
- **String Manipulation:** Appending characters to form a password.
- **List Operations:** Using lists to store characters, numbers, and symbols.

## Project 04 - PyPassword Generator

### Project Overview:
For todayâ€™s project, I built a **Password Generator** in Python. The generator creates a password based on user input, allowing customization for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols. I also explored two versions of the password generator:

---

### 1. **Easy Version:**
Generates the password by appending characters from each list directly.

### 2. **Hard Version:**
Generates the password by first appending the characters to a list, then shuffling the list for randomness.

### 3. **No User Input Version:**
Automatically generates a password with preset values for letters, numbers, and symbols.
