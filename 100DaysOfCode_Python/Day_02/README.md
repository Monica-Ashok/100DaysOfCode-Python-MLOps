## Project 02 - Tip Calculator
In this project, we'll use the concepts covered above to build a simple yet practical Tip Calculator. I have used the code to showcase the working of the system based on arithmetic priority using PEMDASLR Rule.
PEMDAS is an acronym that stands for the order of operations in math: 
- P: Parentheses
- E: Exponents
- M: Multiplication
- D: Division
- A: Addition
- S: Subtraction
- LR: The operation take place from Left to Right.
