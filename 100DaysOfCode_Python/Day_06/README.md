# Day 06 - Python Functions & Karel

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Defining Functions:** Understanding how to create and call functions in Python.  
- **Indentation in Python:** Exploring Python's indentation rules for clean, error-free code.  
- **While Loops:** Using `while` loops for iterative tasks.  
- **Challenges:** Applying loops and functions to solve hurdles challenges with variable heights.

## Project 05 - Escaping the Maze

### Project Overview:
For todayâ€™s project, I built a **Maze Escape Program** using Python. The program uses loops and conditional statements to navigate through a maze and find the exit. This project helped solidify my understanding of functions and loops.

### 1. **Hurdles Challenge Using While Loops:**
Solved the hurdles challenge by incorporating a `while` loop to navigate and jump over obstacles.

### 2. **Jumping Over Hurdles with Variable Heights:**
Enhanced the solution by considering hurdles of varying heights, using additional conditions to determine the appropriate jump.

### 3. **Final Project - Escaping the Maze:**
Created a program to escape a maze by combining:
- **While Loops:** For continuous navigation.
- **Conditional Statements:** To determine the direction and action (move, turn, or jump).

### Note:
While testing the maze escape program, I encountered edge cases where the program entered infinite loops due to specific conditions. These scenarios are addressed and optimized in the v2.0 of the project.
