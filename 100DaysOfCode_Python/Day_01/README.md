## Day 01 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Key Components: 
- Printing to the Console in Python
    - Learn how to output information to the console using print().
- String Manipulation and Code Intelligence
  - Explore string methods to modify and manipulate text data.
- Debugging
  - Tips for identifying and fixing issues in your code
- The Python Input Function
  - How to get user input with input() and process it.
- Python Variables
  - Understanding variables and how to store data.
- Variable Naming
  - Best practices for naming variables in Python.

## Project 01 - Band Name Generator
In this project, weâ€™ll be creating a fun and simple Python program that generates a band name based on the user's input. The user will be asked to provide two pieces of information: the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet. The program will then combine these two inputs to generate a creative and unique band name!

This project will help you get familiar with:
- Using the input() function to gather data from users.
- String concatenation to combine user inputs into a single output.
- Displaying output using the print() function.
